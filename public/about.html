  I am currently a undergraduate student who is very passionate about technology in terms of its 
  potential in solving complex worldwide problems and being of positivie impact to the world
</p>

<p>
  My current interests lie in the use of computer vision in sports, in particular football(soccer)
  and the advances that technology has in sports. I also find breaking down problems into smaller chunks quite fascinating
  and how it might reflect in our daily lives as we come across various human challenges along the way
</p>

<p>
  The impact of advancement in technology to society is also something I am fascinated by. How does the interplay between
  technology and human interaction justify the case for or against advancement in technology? Just because we can, does that mean we 
  ought to?
</p>

<p>
  In terms of sustainability, I would want to explore the aspect of energy as humans will almost certainly always need it. The trajectory that the renewable and clean energy sector is taking and the significance 
  that is being given to it, what are the nuances that dictate whether to place emphasis on technological advancements in energy or sth else seemingly more profitable.
